SUMMARY ON EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of examining datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often using visual methods. It involves data cleaning, calculating statistical summaries, and creating visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, and box plots. EDA helps in understanding the data, detecting anomalies, identifying patterns and trends, and generating initial insights and hypotheses for further analysis. This process is essential for making informed decisions about data preprocessing and modeling.

INSIGHT

EDA provides several key insights into data:

1. Distribution: Understanding how data is distributed, including skewness and kurtosis.
2. Central Tendency: Identifying mean, median, and mode to understand the center of the data.
3. Variability: Assessing the spread of the data using range, variance, and standard deviation.
4. Relationships: Discovering correlations and associations between variables.
5. Outliers: Detecting unusual data points that can affect analysis.
6. Patterns and Trends: Identifying patterns, trends, and seasonal effects.
7. Missing Data: Recognizing and addressing gaps in the data.

These insights guide the data preprocessing steps and inform subsequent modeling and analysis.
